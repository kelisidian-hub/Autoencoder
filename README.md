# Autoencoder
create an auto-encoder on python, the frame used in this project is tensorflow2.0

use this auto-encoder, we can compress high dimensional data to low dimensional represention

extract encoder and decoder from the trained auto-encoder, and test encoder and decoder in MNIST data set, which show the encoder and decoder work well.
